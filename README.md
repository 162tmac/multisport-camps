## About The Project

![Landing Page ScreenShot](./assets/images/README-images/landing-screenshot.jpeg)

This is a static website built with HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap. It was made for my first project with the Code Institute in Dublin.

The website is to be used by a group of teachers to promote their sport summers camps and allow users to make bookings online.
There are pages for information about the camp, the location and contact and booking areas.




### Built With

* HTML5 & CSS3
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

## Further Additions

### Contact Form
* At the moment, the contact form does nothing.
In the future, I hope to add an email API to the contact form so the user can actually send an email to the camp provider.
APIs are out of the scope of this project and I'm also waiting on confirmation from the provider.

### Booking Form
* Same goes for the booking form.
I hope to connect a payment provider such as Stripe to this and allow users to make booking, where then a confirmation email will be sent to both user & provider.

### Content of the website
* I don't have some of the information for the camps yet.
Content such as phone numbers and email addresses I have filled with placeholder text.
