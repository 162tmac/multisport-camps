## About The Project

![Landing Page ScreenShot](./assets/images/README-images/landing-screenshot.JPG)

This is a static website built with HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap. It was made for my first project with the Code Institute in Dublin.

The website is to be used by a group of teachers to promote their sport summers camps and allow users to make bookings online.
There are pages for information about the camp, the location and contact and booking areas.



### Built With

* HTML5 & CSS3
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

## Further Additions

### Contact Form
* At the moment, the contact form does nothing.
In the future, I hope to add an email API to the contact form so the user can actually send an email to the camp provider.
APIs are out of the scope of this project and I'm also waiting on confirmation from the provider.

### Booking Form
* Same goes for the booking form.
I hope to connect a payment provider such as Stripe to this and allow users to make booking, where then a confirmation email will be sent to both user & provider.

### Content of the website
* I don't have some of the information for the camps yet.
Content such as phone numbers and email addresses I have filled with placeholder text.

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Landing Index Page - allows users to navigate through the site and provides a snapshot of the different information contained on it.
- About Page - Gives more detailed information to users such as the price of the camp and times it is on.
- Location Page - Shows the exact location of the camp on Google Maps which can easily be opened in their app.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
#### Contact Form
* At the moment, the contact form does nothing.
In the future, I hope to add an email API to the contact form so the user can actually send an email to the camp provider.
APIs are out of the scope of this project and I'm also waiting on confirmation from the provider.

#### Booking Form
* Same goes for the booking form.
I hope to connect a payment provider such as Stripe to this and allow users to make booking, where then a confirmation email will be sent to both user & provider.

#### Content of the website
* I don't have some of the information for the camps yet.
Content such as phone numbers and email addresses I have filled with placeholder text.

## Technologies Used

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
* HTML5 & CSS3
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
